## Abstract

*The Pokedex App is a Progressive Web Application that gives you the ability to search through the original 151 Pokemon and quickly find information on them. This will be a very useful app for a person who is in a real life Poke-battle and needs to find quick information about Pokemon, even without internet service!

- Pokedex : when I visit the app, I should be able to select the Pokemon Card by name. 
- Pokedex desktop: when I visit the app, all Pokemon should be displayed.
- Home-Page: as a user, I should be able to access a page about how to use the app.
- Selected Pokemon: As a user, I can click a card, and see that Pokemon’s details. When a Pokemon’s details are displayed, none of the other Pokemon cards will be visible.
- When a Pokemon’s details are displayed, the user should have a way to return to the main view of all movies.
