## Abstract

*The PoKedeX App is a Progressive Web Application that gives you the ability to search through the original 151 Pokemon and quickly find information on them. This will be a very useful app for a person who is in a real life Poke-battle and needs to find quick information about Pokemon, even without internet service!

- PoKedeX : when I visit the app, I should be able to select the PoKemon Card by name. 
- PoKedeX desktop: when I visit the app, all PoKemon should be displayed.
- Home-Page: as a user, I should be able to access a page about how to use the app.
- Selected PoKemon: As a user, I can click a card, and see that Pokemon’s details. When a PoKemon’s details are displayed, none of the other PoKemon cards will be visible.
- When a PoKemon’s details are displayed, the user should have a way to return to the main view of all movies.
